## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned using CSS grid. How we can use place-items property to center the child elements inside a grid
container. I have also learnt the default behavior when we set the display to grid for any element.

```css
body {
    background-color: var(--slate-300);
    display:grid;
    place-items:center;
    gap:1.5rem;
    margin:0;
    min-height:100vh;
    
}
```

### Continued developmet
I would continue to focus on version control and responsive design in the future projects as I forget sometimes to
make regular commits. In this project as well, I have not made a single commit until I have already finished everything. Using git for version control is new to me and I want to take is full help in the future.
Also I want to enhance my abilities for responsive design using media queries and CSS grid and flexbox layout.


### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks: A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This resource provided a thorough understanding of CSS Grid, which I used extensively for layout.
